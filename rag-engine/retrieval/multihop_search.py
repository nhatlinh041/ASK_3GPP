"""
Multi-hop graph traversal — follows REFERENCES_CHUNK edges across specs.
Implements 5 hop patterns from the research plan.

REFERENCES_CHUNK now covers BOTH internal (same-spec) và external (cross-spec)
section references. Edge property `is_external` phân biệt 2 nhóm; variable-length
traversal `[:REFERENCES_CHUNK*1..3]` đi qua cả 2 đồng nhất. Để giới hạn cross-spec,
filter `WHERE r.is_external = true` (kèm `r.confidence >= 0.7` cho high-quality refs).
